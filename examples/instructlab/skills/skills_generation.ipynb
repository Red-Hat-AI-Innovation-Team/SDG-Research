    "\n",
    "### Customizing Model Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "The LAB framework enables us to shape how a model responds to various tasks by training it on carefully crafted examples. Want your model to write emails in your company's tone? Need it to follow specific formatting guidelines? This customization is achieved through what the paper defines as compositional skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compositional skills are tasks that combine different abilities to handle complex queries. For example, if you want your model to write company emails about quarterly performance, it needs to:\n",
    "- Understand financial concepts\n",
    "- Perform basic arithmetic\n",
    "- Write in your preferred communication style\n",
    "- Follow your organization's email format\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demo Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to:\n",
    "1. Set up a teacher model for generating training data\n",
    "2. Create examples that reflect your preferred style and approach\n",
    "3. Generate Synthetic Data\n",
    "4. Validate that the generated data matches your requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal is to create training data that will help align the model with your specific needs, whether that's matching your company's communication style, following particular protocols, or handling specialized tasks in your preferred way."

    "In this notebook, we demonstrated how to teach a custom skill to a language model using the InstructLab Skill Data Generator (SDG). Starting from a small set of seed examples, we walked through the full synthetic data generation pipeline ‚Äî including context creation, question generation, response synthesis, evaluation, and filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "We explored a real-world use case: **transforming unstructured user feedback into structured markdown tables**, and showed how the LAB framework can automate the generation of high-quality, instructional training data at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is especially powerful for procedural or domain-specific tasks where labeled data is scarce but consistent task logic can be modeled. With just a few carefully curated seed examples, you can unlock scalable skill creation and push new capabilities into LLMs with minimal manual effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "You‚Äôre now ready to use these synthetic examples for Fine-tuning small models! \n",
